_See the [Cookbook Contributor's Guide](https://projectpythia.org/cookbook-guide) for step-by-step instructions on how to create your new Cookbook and get it hosted on the [Pythia Cookbook Gallery](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org)!_

This Project Pythia Cookbook focuses on analyzing a tornadic event using a variety of datasets. A synoptic and mesoscale environment analysis will be done using ERA5 reanalysis and archived operational High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) forecast output. Analysis of lightning flashes will be provided with GOES 16 Global Lightning Mapper (GLM) lightning flash data. Observed soundings will be plotted and analyze using the `SounderPy` python package. Mosaic Radar and derived products will be analyzed from GridRad grids.

## Motivation

Terrain has long been theorized to play a significant role in improving the local severe convective environment under the proper conditions. This effect has ben noted amongst many of the recent significant tornadic events, including the Turin EF3 of 2023, The Duanesburg EF3 of 2014, the Mechanicville F3 of 1998, and the Great Barington tornado of 1995, though this is far from an exhaustive list. Significant tornadic impacts have occured in the Great Barrington and Mechanicville events, warranting study of such events to improve understanding and predictability. By the end of this cookbood, you should be able to undertake a quality analysis of a multitude of aspects of a significant tornadic event, from synoptic scale to storm scale analysis.

## Structure

(State one or more sections that will comprise the notebook. E.g., _This cookbook is broken up into two main sections - "Foundations" and "Example Workflows."_ Then, describe each section below.)

### Section 1 ( Replace with the title of this section, e.g. "Foundations" )

(Add content for this section, e.g., "The foundational content includes ... ")

### Section 2 ( Replace with the title of this section, e.g. "Example workflows" )

(Add content for this section, e.g., "Example workflows include ... ")

## Running the Notebooks

You can either run the notebook using [Binder](https://binder.projectpythia.org/) or on your local machine.

### Running on Binder

The simplest way to interact with a Jupyter Notebook is through
[Binder](https://binder.projectpythia.org/), which enables the execution of a
[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) in the cloud. The details of how this works are not
important for now. All you need to know is how to launch a Pythia
Cookbooks chapter via Binder. Simply navigate your mouse to
the top right corner of the book chapter you are viewing and click
on the rocket ship icon, (see figure below), and be sure to select
“launch Binder”. After a moment you should be presented with a
notebook that you can interact with. I.e. you’ll be able to execute
and even change the example programs. You’ll see that the code cells
have no output at first, until you execute them by pressing
{kbd}`Shift`\+{kbd}`Enter`. Complete details on how to interact with
a live Jupyter notebook are described in [Getting Started with
Jupyter](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter).

Note, not all Cookbook chapters are executable. If you do not see
the rocket ship icon, such as on this page, you are not viewing an
executable book chapter.


### Running on Your Own Machine

If you are interested in running this material locally on your computer, you will need to follow this workflow:

(Replace "cookbook-example" with the title of your cookbooks)

1. Clone the `https://github.com/ProjectPythia/cookbook-example` repository:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ProjectPythia/cookbook-example.git
   ```

1. Move into the `cookbook-example` directory
   ```bash
   cd cookbook-example
   ```
1. Create and activate your conda environment from the `environment.yml` file
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate cookbook-example
   ```
1. Move into the `notebooks` directory and start up Jupyterlab
   ```bash
   cd notebooks/
   jupyter lab
   ```
