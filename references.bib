  abstract = {Forecasters have surmised that prominent mountain ranges and river valleys in eastern New York and western New England (e.g., Hudson and Mohawk River valleys; Adirondack, Catskill, Green, and Berkshire Mountains) affect convective initiation and subsequent severe weather distribution. The purpose of this research is to document the climatology of severe weather in this region with respect to the terrain and the synoptic-scale flow direction. The area of study was subdivided into overlapping 0.5° grid boxes, and the number of severe weather reports from the database (1950–98) was tabulated for each box. These severe weather reports were then normalized and contoured over a terrain map. A logarithmic correction factor was applied to the data in order to minimize potential population bias effects. The results of this correction were compared with cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning strikes (independent of population bias) from 1989 to 1998 (1990 missing) for severe weather days in the same region. The severe weather and CG lightning database also was stratified by 700-hPa flow direction into northwest and southwest flow regimes to see if subtle terrain influences on the severe weather distribution could be detected. Regions where the CG lightning and severe weather stratifications agree well include the southern Adirondacks, Berkshires, and the Litchfield Hills of northwest Connecticut. Regions where discrepancies exist between the two stratifications include the Catskills and the mid–Hudson valley. The results of both severe weather and lightning stratifications show that there are preferred regions of upstate New York and western New England for both CG lightning and severe weather to occur depending on the 700-hPa flow direction.}

  abstract = {The complex terrain at the intersection of the Mohawk and Hudson valleys of New York has an impact on the development and evolution of severe convection in the region. Specifically, previous research has concluded that terrain-channeled flow in the Mohawk and Hudson valleys likely contributes to increased low-level wind shear and instability in the valleys during severe weather events such as the historic 31 May 1998 event that produced a strong (F3) tornado in Mechanicville, New York. The goal of this study is to further examine the impact of terrain channeling on severe convection by analyzing a high-resolution WRF Model simulation of the 31 May 1998 event. Results from the simulation suggest that terrain-channeled flow resulted in the localized formation of an enhanced low-level moisture gradient, resembling a dryline, at the intersection of the Mohawk and Hudson valleys. East of this boundary, the environment was characterized by stronger low-level wind shear and greater low-level moisture and instability, increasing tornadogenesis potential. A simulated supercell intensified after crossing the boundary, as the larger instability and streamwise vorticity of the low-level inflow was ingested into the supercell updraft. These results suggest that terrain can have a key role in producing mesoscale inhomogeneities that impact the evolution of severe convection. Recognition of these terrain-induced boundaries may help in anticipating where the risk of severe weather may be locally enhanced.}

  abstract = {Many studies have aimed to identify novel storm characteristics that are indicative of current or future severe weather potential using a combination of ground-based radar observations and severe reports. However, this is often done on a small scale using limited case studies on the order of tens to hundreds of storms due to how time-intensive this process is. Herein, we introduce the GridRad-Severe dataset, a database including ∼100 severe weather days per year and upward of 1.3 million objectively tracked storms from 2010 to 2019. Composite radar volumes spanning objectively determined, report-centered domains are created for each selected day using the GridRad compositing technique, with dates objectively determined using report thresholds defined to capture the highest-end severe weather days from each year, evenly distributed across all severe report types (tornadoes, severe hail, and severe wind). Spatiotemporal domain bounds for each event are objectively determined to encompass both the majority of reports and the time of convection initiation. Severe weather reports are matched to storms that are objectively tracked using the radar data, so the evolution of the storm cells and their severe weather production can be evaluated. Herein, we apply storm mode (single-cell, multicell, or mesoscale convective system storms) and right-moving supercell classification techniques to the dataset, and revisit various questions about severe storms and their bulk characteristics posed and evaluated in past work. Additional applications of this dataset are reviewed for possible future studies.}

  abstract = {Although uncommon as compared to other regions of the United States, the Northeast can experience strong EF3+ tornadoes,
some of which have had profound impacts on the region. Due to the prominent topography of the region, many of the tornadic supercells
occurring in the region experience a sizeable change in elevation throughout their track. This study seeks to better understand the impacts
of local topography on the intensity and overall progression of a locally significant tornadic event: the Turin, NY EF3 of 2023. With
consideration of previous studies involving the effects of terrain on tornados, we broke terrain effects on the storm into two factors: valley
channeling; a valley favorably oriented to the boundary layer wind direction can locally back winds, increasing low-level shear/helicity
and thus convective intensity, as well as vortex stretching, a storm’s descent down terrain such as off a hill can stretch and spin up the
storm’s mesocyclone, and vice versa for ascent of terrain. Model simulations of the Turin supercell were carried out using the Weather
and Research Forecasting (WRF) model to test the effects of various terrain configurations on the strength and progression of the storm,
providing an in-depth analysis of both the valley channeling and vortex stretching terrain effects. It was found that the combination of both
effects contributed to the intensity of the Turin tornado, as the storm was noticeably weaker in the absence of these effects. It was noted
that terrain effects acted in addition to other effects, such as storm mergers}

abstract     = {The 22 May 2014 Duanesburg, New York, supercell produced an enhanced Fujita scale category 3 (EF3)
tornado and 10-cm-diameter hail. The synoptic setup for the event was ambiguous compared to other docu-
mented cases of Northeast tornadoes. Mesoscale inhomogeneities due to terrain and baroclinic boundaries
played a key role in the evolution and severity of the storm. The storm initiated at the intersection of an outflow
boundary and a north–south-oriented baroclinic boundary. The mesocyclone was able to sustain itself as a result
of sufficiently large amounts of low-level streamwise vorticity near the boundary despite subcritical values of 0–
6-km vertical wind shear. Differential heating across the north–south-oriented boundary strengthened the
pressure gradient across it. Strengthening ageostrophic flow across the boundary induced greater upslope flow
along the southeastern slope of the Adirondack Mountains and induced terrain channeling up the Mohawk
River valley. The channeling led to a maximum in moisture flux convergence and instability in the Mohawk
valley. As the supercell moved into the Mohawk valley, radar and lightning data indicated a rapid intensification
of the storm. Cold temperatures aloft due to the presence of an elevated mixed layer (EML) coincided with the
surface instability to yield a local environment in the Mohawk valley favorable for extremely large hail. As the
storm crossed the boundary, large values of 0–1-km wind shear, streamwise vorticity, and low lifting conden-
sation levels combined to create a local environment favorable for tornadogenesis.}

  abstract = {The process of tornadogenesis in complex terrain environments has received relatively little research
attention to date. Here, an analysis is presented of a long-lived supercell that became tornadic over complex terrain in association with the Great Barrington, Massachusetts (GBR), F3 tornado of 29 May 1995.
The GBR tornado left an almost continuous 50–1000-m-wide damage path that stretched for 50 km.
The apparent rarity of significant tornadogenesis in rough terrain from a supercell well documented in
operational Doppler radar motivated this case study. Doppler radar observations showed that the GBR
supercell possessed a midlevel mesocyclone well prior to tornadogenesis and that the mesocyclone intensified as it crossed the eastern edge of New York’s Catskill Mountains and entered the Hudson Valley.
Tornadogenesis occurred as the GBR mesocyclone crossed the Hudson Valley and ascended the highlands
to the east. Subsequently, the mesocyclone weakened as it approached the Taconic Range in western
Massachusetts before it intensified again as it moved downslope into the Housatonic Valley where it was
associated with the GBR tornado. Because of a dearth of significant mesoscale surface and upper-air
observations, the conclusions and inferences presented in this paper must be necessarily limited and speculative. What data were available suggested that on a day when the mesoscale environment was supportive
of supercell thunderstorm development, according to conventional indicators of wind shear and atmospheric stability, topographic configurations and the associated channeling of ambient low-level flows
conspired to create local orographic enhancements to tornadogenesis potential. Numerical experimentation
is needed to address these inferences, speculative points, and related issues raised by the GBR case
study.}

  abstract     =  {The evolution of supercell thunderstorms traversing complex terrain is not well understood and remains a
short-term forecast challenge across the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. Although case studies have
been conducted, there has been no large multicase observational analysis focusing on the central and southern Appalachians.
To address this gap, we analyzed 62 isolated warm-season supercells that occurred in this region. Each supercell was categorized as either crossing (;40%) or noncrossing (;60%) based on their maintenance of supercellular structure while traversing
prominent terrain. The structural evolution of each storm was analyzed via operationally relevant parameters extracted from
WSR-88D radar data. The most significant differences in radar-observed structure among storm categories were associated
with the mesocyclone; crossing storms exhibited stronger, wider, and deeper mesocyclones, along with more prominent and
persistent hook echoes. Crossing storms also moved faster. Among the supercells that crossed the most prominent peaks and
ridges, significant increases in base reflectivity, vertically integrated liquid, echo tops, and mesocyclone intensity/depth were
observed, in conjunction with more frequent large hail and tornado reports, as the storms ascended windward slopes. Then, as
the supercells descended leeward slopes, significant increases in mesocyclone depth and tornado frequency were observed.
Such results reinforce the notion that supercell evolution can be modulated substantially by passage through and over complex terrain.},
