abstract = {Forecasters have surmised that prominent mountain ranges and river valleys in eastern New York and western New England (e.g., Hudson and Mohawk River valleys; Adirondack, Catskill, Green, and Berkshire Mountains) affect convective initiation and subsequent severe weather distribution. The purpose of this research is to document the climatology of severe weather in this region with respect to the terrain and the synoptic-scale flow direction. The area of study was subdivided into overlapping 0.5° grid boxes, and the number of severe weather reports from the database (1950–98) was tabulated for each box. These severe weather reports were then normalized and contoured over a terrain map. A logarithmic correction factor was applied to the data in order to minimize potential population bias effects. The results of this correction were compared with cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning strikes (independent of population bias) from 1989 to 1998 (1990 missing) for severe weather days in the same region. The severe weather and CG lightning database also was stratified by 700-hPa flow direction into northwest and southwest flow regimes to see if subtle terrain influences on the severe weather distribution could be detected. Regions where the CG lightning and severe weather stratifications agree well include the southern Adirondacks, Berkshires, and the Litchfield Hills of northwest Connecticut. Regions where discrepancies exist between the two stratifications include the Catskills and the mid–Hudson valley. The results of both severe weather and lightning stratifications show that there are preferred regions of upstate New York and western New England for both CG lightning and severe weather to occur depending on the 700-hPa flow direction.},

abstract = {The complex terrain at the intersection of the Mohawk and Hudson valleys of New York has an impact on the development and evolution of severe convection in the region. Specifically, previous research has concluded that terrain-channeled flow in the Mohawk and Hudson valleys likely contributes to increased low-level wind shear and instability in the valleys during severe weather events such as the historic 31 May 1998 event that produced a strong (F3) tornado in Mechanicville, New York. The goal of this study is to further examine the impact of terrain channeling on severe convection by analyzing a high-resolution WRF Model simulation of the 31 May 1998 event. Results from the simulation suggest that terrain-channeled flow resulted in the localized formation of an enhanced low-level moisture gradient, resembling a dryline, at the intersection of the Mohawk and Hudson valleys. East of this boundary, the environment was characterized by stronger low-level wind shear and greater low-level moisture and instability, increasing tornadogenesis potential. A simulated supercell intensified after crossing the boundary, as the larger instability and streamwise vorticity of the low-level inflow was ingested into the supercell updraft. These results suggest that terrain can have a key role in producing mesoscale inhomogeneities that impact the evolution of severe convection. Recognition of these terrain-induced boundaries may help in anticipating where the risk of severe weather may be locally enhanced.},

abstract = {Many studies have aimed to identify novel storm characteristics that are indicative of current or future severe weather potential using a combination of ground-based radar observations and severe reports. However, this is often done on a small scale using limited case studies on the order of tens to hundreds of storms due to how time-intensive this process is. Herein, we introduce the GridRad-Severe dataset, a database including ∼100 severe weather days per year and upward of 1.3 million objectively tracked storms from 2010 to 2019. Composite radar volumes spanning objectively determined, report-centered domains are created for each selected day using the GridRad compositing technique, with dates objectively determined using report thresholds defined to capture the highest-end severe weather days from each year, evenly distributed across all severe report types (tornadoes, severe hail, and severe wind). Spatiotemporal domain bounds for each event are objectively determined to encompass both the majority of reports and the time of convection initiation. Severe weather reports are matched to storms that are objectively tracked using the radar data, so the evolution of the storm cells and their severe weather production can be evaluated. Herein, we apply storm mode (single-cell, multicell, or mesoscale convective system storms) and right-moving supercell classification techniques to the dataset, and revisit various questions about severe storms and their bulk characteristics posed and evaluated in past work. Additional applications of this dataset are reviewed for possible future studies.},

abstract = {Although uncommon as compared to other regions of the United States, the Northeast can experience strong EF3+ tornadoes,
some of which have had profound impacts on the region. Due to the prominent topography of the region, many of the tornadic supercells
occurring in the region experience a sizeable change in elevation throughout their track. This study seeks to better understand the impacts
of local topography on the intensity and overall progression of a locally significant tornadic event: the Turin, NY EF3 of 2023. With
consideration of previous studies involving the effects of terrain on tornados, we broke terrain effects on the storm into two factors: valley
channeling; a valley favorably oriented to the boundary layer wind direction can locally back winds, increasing low-level shear/helicity
and thus convective intensity, as well as vortex stretching, a storm’s descent down terrain such as off a hill can stretch and spin up the
storm’s mesocyclone, and vice versa for ascent of terrain. Model simulations of the Turin supercell were carried out using the Weather
and Research Forecasting (WRF) model to test the effects of various terrain configurations on the strength and progression of the storm,
providing an in-depth analysis of both the valley channeling and vortex stretching terrain effects. It was found that the combination of both
effects contributed to the intensity of the Turin tornado, as the storm was noticeably weaker in the absence of these effects. It was noted
that terrain effects acted in addition to other effects, such as storm mergers},
