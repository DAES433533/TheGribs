## Conclusion

This project set out to evaluate how local topography contributes to the intensity, structure, and spatial distribution of severe thunderstorm events in the Northeastern United States. By comparing two tornado cases with differing synoptic environments but shared exposure to river-valley terrain, our multi-dataset analysis highlights the ways in which complex terrain can meaningfully alter the near-storm environment. Across the GridRad composites, synoptic fields, GLM lightning patterns and reanalysis soundings, consistent signals emerged: valleys and sharp changes in elevation can channel background flow, focus low-level moisture transport, and locally enhance parameters such as CAPE, shear, and storm-relative helicity. These mesoscale modifications were particularly apparent in the New Hampshire case, where the Connecticut River Valley supported a more favorable thermodynamic and kinematic profile than the broader regional environment. The New Jersey case, while still tornadic, reflected a synoptic setup where terrain effects played a subtler role, illustrating how background flow direction govern the extent of terrain modification.

Taken together, our results reinforce long-standing hypotheses in the literature that north south river valleys and adjacent elevated terrain can amplify ingredients important for tornadogenesis, especially when synoptic flow aligns with valley orientation. At the same time, the contrasting behavior between the two events shows the importance of viewing terrain effects not in isolation but as part of a larger interplay between synoptic forcing, mesoscale boundaries, storm morphology, and environmental heterogeneity. By integrating multiple observational and reanalysis datasets, this project demonstrates the value of multi-scale analysis when assessing severe thunderstorm potential in the complex landscapes of the Northeast.
