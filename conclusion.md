## Conclusion

The two Northeast tornadic events examined in this project—the 5 May 2018 Merrimack County, NH EF-1 and the 29 July 2021 Central New Jersey tornado family—highlight the complex interplay between synoptic forcing, mesoscale processes, and local terrain in shaping severe convective outcomes across the region. While both events occurred within supportive large-scale environments, their evolution and intensity reflected distinct terrain-modified influences that aligned with findings from previous literature. In the New Hampshire case, the synoptic setup featured a progressive bow echo entering the north–south oriented Connecticut River Valley, where locally backed surface flow, increased low-level moisture, and terrain-channeled winds helped create a more favorable pre-convective environment than surrounding areas. The resulting line-embedded tornado maintained a long track across varying elevation, consistent with prior studies identifying the role of valleys in enhancing low-level shear, streamwise vorticity, and buoyant inflow. The New Jersey outbreak, driven by a different synoptic regime involving a drifting mesolow and widespread destabilization, demonstrated how robust environmental shear and instability can yield significant tornadoes even in the absence of strong terrain-channeled enhancement. However, modest topographic influences were still evident as storms interacted with local upland gradients near the Delaware Water Gap and central New Jersey.

Across both cases, the combined analyses from ERA5 and HRRR fields, GOES-16 GLM lightning, GridRad radar composites, and SounderPy-derived vertical profiles provide consistent evidence that terrain can meaningfully influence the mesoscale environment in the Northeast. Soundings extracted directly along the tornado tracks revealed differences in moisture depth, boundary-layer structure, shear profiles, CAPE distribution, and hodograph curvature that aligned with the observed storm behaviors. The NH environment exhibited stronger low-level wind curvature, deeper moisture, and a more favorable buoyancy profile than its surrounding region—conditions that may have been locally amplified by the Connecticut River Valley. In contrast, the NJ soundings displayed strong synoptic-scale shear and adequate instability but with a more uniform boundary-layer structure, suggesting that topography played a secondary rather than primary role.

Taken together, these cases reinforce the broader understanding that terrain in the Northeast does not merely redirect storm motion but can locally alter the near-storm environment in ways that support tornadogenesis, especially in valley corridors oriented parallel to the low-level flow. At the same time, the NJ case demonstrates that significant tornadoes in the region can also arise from predominantly synoptic-driven setups, even where terrain effects are less pronounced. The integration of multiple datasets in this project—radar, lightning, reanalysis, and modeled soundings—supports a more complete depiction of how storms evolve in complex terrain, ultimately underscoring the importance of recognizing localized environmental enhancements when forecasting severe weather in the Northeast.
